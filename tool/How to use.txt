# I think it's not so difficult for Chinese developers to get use to them,
# but still necessary to explain something to foreign developers.

# 2.How to use "crass-0.4.14.0-final.zip"?

Crass is a tool witten by Chinese developer and used to extract resources from visual novel game. 
It supports many engines but has not updated for years, so you may find it faild to extract something new.
Also, it uses the models from game engines themselves to extract, so you can also meet some situation like:
"Sorry, but developer don't want you to extract them by illegal way."
But dispite them all, we can still extract some games created by some common engine and didn't been protected.

In this game, you just have to do:
--Extract zip file and open "CrageGUI.exe"
--Select "Source File" then click "Browse"
--Choose script.xp3 inside game folder
--Click "Execute" to extract selected resource file, it will automatically create a folder named by .xp3 file itself.
--Goto Crass's folder and search for the folder called "script"
--Copy it to your position
--After this, just use the same way to extract every resources files inside original game folder.
